!!! Not maintained further. I am currently [rebulding the app as a side project](https://github.com/WE-Kaito/calorie-and-workout-tracker-mobile) using React Native and Firebase.  

As my first graduation project, this was very rough around the edges and tought me much. 
Data is only saved in the browsers local storage, so not using a database and user accounts is also an issue, especially for mobile use.
